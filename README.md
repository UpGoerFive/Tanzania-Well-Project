# Tanzania-Well-Project
A project to classify well condition in Tanzania. More information [here](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/page/23/)
## Business Problem

The purpose of this project is to use Machine Learning Classification models to predict the functional status of water wells in Tanzania. These include Decision Trees, Bagged Trees, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Adaboost, and using GridsearchCV to identify the best parameters for each. The different status groups for classification are functional, non functional, and functional but needs repair. 

The hope is that by gaining a better understanding of the factors that impact water pumps we are able to improve maintenance and ensure all pumps stay functional.  The importance of having accessibility of water for these Tanzanian communities is that it decreases diseases, increases education, and increases the economy overall.

## Data 
The data that was used to train our models was provided by Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water. You may also able to download the datasets from https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/page/23/.
